# AARONDEV.CO.UK - Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for AARONDEV.CO.UK, a personal website project that showcases full-stack development skills using Node.js, Nunjucks, Bootstrap, SCSS, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is the culmination of knowledge gained from a software apprenticeship and represents a personal journey into full-stack development. The website serves as a portfolio and blog, highlighting projects, thoughts, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine for server-side scripting.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Nunjucks**: A powerful templating engine with inheritance and asynchronous control.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **SCSS**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.

## Features

- **Dynamic Templating**: Utilizes Nunjucks for reusable components and layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Leverages Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly user interface.
- **Custom Styling**: Employs SCSS for maintainable and scalable stylesheets.
- **Static File Serving**: Configured to serve assets efficiently with Express.
- **SEO and Accessibility**: Implements best practices for search engine optimization and accessibility standards.

## Scripts and Running the Application

This project is equipped with several scripts to facilitate development and deployment. Below are the key scripts and their descriptions:

### `npm start`

This script starts the development server, allowing you to view the application on your local machine.

```bash
npm start
```

After running this command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in action.

### `npm run build`

This script compiles SCSS files into CSS and bundles JavaScript files using Webpack. It prepares the application for production by optimizing assets.

```bash
npm run build
```

### `npm run lint`

This script runs ESLint to check for any linting errors in your JavaScript files, ensuring code quality and consistency.

```bash
npm run lint
```

### `npm run dev`

This script runs the application in development mode with hot reloading enabled. It's useful for development as it automatically refreshes the application when changes are detected.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### `npm run test`

This script runs any tests that you have set up for your application. It's essential for maintaining a stable codebase.

```bash
npm run test
```

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
